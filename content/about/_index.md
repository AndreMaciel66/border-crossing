heading: "Our mission is to integrate historically-segregated audiences and musicians through the performance of choral music. We envision a landscape where singers and audiences more closely reflect the racial and cultural composition of the Twin Cities."
description: "Founded in 2017, Border CrosSing envisions a fundamental change in classical music culture, so that every concert, every audience, and the artists on stage truly reflect the cultural reality in which we live. Our work provides opportunities for people from different communities to understand each other in new ways through our multi-lingual Puentes concert series, educational programs in schools, and collaborations with Minnesotaâ€™s most important cultural organizations, including The Schubert Club and Minnesota Orchestra."
